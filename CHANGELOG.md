# Change Log

3.29 - New Build Release
  - 3.29.119 - 2026-02-24 - Refreshed `GUIDE.md` high-level workflow documentation to match current app behavior (multi-baseline comparison, Save Data export, richer report content flow, annotation formatting/dragging, and report metadata controls).
  - 3.29.118 - 2026-02-24 - Added drag-to-move support for existing plot annotations (click-and-drag repositions the label/arrow; simple click still opens the annotation edit dialog).
  - 3.29.117 - 2026-02-24 - Fixed annotation default format application: corrected default font size to `14` and reset in-memory annotation defaults on project reset/new project so stale prior formatting no longer carries over unintentionally.
  - 3.29.116 - 2026-02-24 - When loading a project with saved plot history, automatically restore and display the last history plot entry instead of leaving the view unrendered.
  - 3.29.115 - 2026-02-24 - Added `Format...` to annotation edit (click existing annotation) to update that annotation's font/arrow styling and offsets, and changed default annotation format to size `14`, blue text/arrow, and offsets `x=20`, `y=40`.
  - 3.29.114 - 2026-02-24 - Improved startup window placement to clamp size to the current screen and open near the top-center so the app no longer starts off the bottom of shorter displays.
  - 3.29.113 - 2026-02-24 - Renamed the Reports button `Add text block...` to `Add content` and updated its tooltip/README wording to reflect richer content support.
  - 3.29.112 - 2026-02-24 - Narrowed project unsaved-change prompts to dataset add/remove/rename/reorder and plot history add/remove/clear only; `Show` toggles, plot setting edits without creating a plot, and report-only changes now avoid project save prompts (report prompts still track report edits).
  - 3.29.111 - 2026-02-24 - Updated `scripts/build_exe.bat` to exclude unused optional `pywebview` backends and Qt bindings from PyInstaller builds, reducing packaged EXE size growth after the Windows rich text editor feature.
  - 3.29.110 - 2026-02-24 - Fixed packaged EXE rich report text editor launch so `Add text block...` opens the editor directly instead of first spawning a second main app instance.
  - 3.29.109 - 2026-02-23 - Fixed raw time-series outlier `X` overlays in comparison mode to use the selected baseline group average (not just the first baseline dataset), removing the vertical offset from the actual outlier points; also removed unused radar outlier offset overlay handling.
  - 3.29.108 - 2026-02-23 - Restyled the comparison baseline multi-select back to a compact integrated dropdown checklist (no separate header/footer controls) and kept it open during multi-pick, applying the selection only when clicking away (with `Esc` cancel).
  - 3.29.107 - 2026-02-23 - Changed default outlier method to `MAD`, made plot-type switches default Avg type to `mean` (bar), `median` (radar/cartesian), and `raw` (time series), improved outlier marker visibility, kept `Outlier warnings` unchanged during history navigation, warned only once when disabling outlier warnings, and made history delete clear to a blank plot without changing current plot settings.
  - 3.29.106 - 2026-02-23 - Changed the comparison baseline multi-select dropdown to stay open while ticking multiple datasets and commit selections on `OK`/header close/click-away (with `Esc` canceling in-progress changes).
  - 3.29.105 - 2026-02-23 - Replaced the comparison baseline multi-select popup with an integrated dropdown menu (`Menubutton`) using ticked items for multi-selection, reducing the separate picker feel while preserving baseline-group ordering/selection behavior.
  - 3.29.104 - 2026-02-23 - Replaced the clunky Windows text-block add/edit flow with a WebView-based rich content editor (WordPad-like paste/edit UI with normal right-click paste/Ctrl+V for Word/web content including images), keeping the Tk text editor as fallback when `pywebview` is unavailable.
  - 3.29.103 - 2026-02-23 - Added text-block clipboard helpers for pasting rich HTML/text and clipboard images (saved into report assets and inserted as `<img>` tags), improving Word/web copy-paste workflows in reports.
  - 3.29.102 - 2026-02-23 - Added rich HTML support for report text blocks (including pasted web/doc HTML and `<img>` tags) with direct HTML preview/export rendering and PDF text fallback warnings for unsupported rich elements.
  - 3.29.101 - 2026-02-23 - Added report text-only content blocks plus a `Manage content...` editor to edit/remove/reorder report snapshots and text blocks in Tkinter, with HTML/PDF export support.
  - 3.29.100 - 2026-02-23 - Rebalanced report presentation in PDF/HTML exports: increased plot area sizing and reduced comment text size/weight for more proportional snapshot sections.
  - 3.29.99 - 2026-02-23 - Reduced report HTML/preview snapshot plot area width and interactive frame height for a more compact layout.
  - 3.29.98 - 2026-02-23 - Reduced direct PDF report snapshot image sizing to a more compact layout (about half-width) so more content fits per page.
  - 3.29.97 - 2026-02-23 - Replaced report PDF export's HTML/WeasyPrint conversion path with direct JSON-to-PDF rendering via optional `reportlab`, keeping the existing Tkinter export flow unchanged.
  - 3.29.96 - 2026-02-23 - Updated the New Report dialog prompt label from `Project title` to `Report title` while keeping the current project title as the default value.
  - 3.29.95 - 2026-02-23 - Fixed hidden-meta report preview/export headings to show only explicit user snapshot titles (no fallback auto plot titles and no fallback `Snapshot` heading).
  - 3.29.94 - 2026-02-23 - Fixed bar-chart comparison vs grouped baseline so shown datasets that are also in the baseline group plot their true delta vs the grouped baseline average instead of being forced to zero.
  - 3.29.93 - 2026-02-23 - Fixed hidden-meta report snapshot headings to suppress default plot titles across all snapshots (including legacy saved `user_title` values equal to the plot title), and fixed bar comparison plots to respect `Show` for baseline-group datasets on the x-axis.
  - 3.29.92 - 2026-02-23 - Corrected `Incl meta` report checkbox semantics so checked includes metadata and new reports default to metadata hidden; hidden-meta mode suppresses original plot titles in snapshot headings unless a user snapshot title is provided.
  - 3.29.91 - 2026-02-23 - Made reports standalone by removing saved project references, renamed the report "Snapshots" section to "Analysis", and added an `Incl meta` toggle to hide report metadata in preview/export.
  - 3.29.90 - 2026-02-23 - Fixed comparison plotting so datasets included in the selected baseline group can still be plotted (as deltas vs the combined baseline average) when they are checked as Show.
  - 3.29.89 - 2026-02-23 - Moved the `Save Data` button into the Data sources toolbar, replacing the previous `Remove all` button position.
  - 3.29.88 - 2026-02-23 - Added a `Save Data` button between Save project and Guide to export only datasets currently checked as Show to a `.data.json` multi-dataset file.
  - 3.29.87 - 2026-02-19 - Increased radar auto-range lower-bound buffer from 10% to 20% of span when Fixed range is off.
  - 3.29.86 - 2026-02-19 - Documented changelog numbering policy: use the next build number (`BUILD_VERSION + 1`) for release headers and keep entries top-first.
  - 3.29.85 - 2026-02-19 - Removed git-based changelog auto-generation; the app now reads and maintains a single manual `CHANGELOG.md` source.
  - 3.29.84 - 2026-02-19 - Rotated bar value labels automatically when plotting 15+ datasets to reduce overlap in both Matplotlib and Plotly bar charts.
  - 3.29.83 - 2026-02-19 - Restored backward compatibility for Plotly radar helper call arity so older positional call sites still work while supporting multi-baseline IDs.
  - 3.29.82 - 2026-02-19 - Hardened plot-history visibility restore to remap by saved source IDs first and only use unambiguous imported display-name fallback, preventing misbinding after name de-duplication.
  - 3.29.81 - 2026-02-19 - Prevented failed Plotly plot attempts from being added to plot history; history now updates only after a successful render.
  - 3.29.80 - 2026-02-19 - Fixed project save name normalization to prevent repeated `.proj` suffixes and hardened project-load clearing so non-polar current views do not block loading.
  - 3.29.79 - 2026-02-19 - Stabilized "% of dataset mean" normalization by falling back to full data-span scaling when mixed-sign data makes the mean near zero.
  - 3.29.78 - 2026-02-19 - Updated radar auto-range so the inner radial bound defaults to `minimum - 10% * (maximum - minimum)` while keeping the outer bound at the plotted maximum (when Fixed range is off).
  - 3.29.77 - 2026-02-18 - Anchored the baseline multi-select popup below the baseline dropdown button with a post-layout reposition pass and pointer-based fallback placement.
  - 3.29.76 - 2026-02-18 - Made the baseline dropdown list draggable/closable and centered it when the anchor control is unavailable or returns invalid coordinates.
  - 3.29.75 - 2026-02-16 - Fix Plotly radar call to pass baseline_ids.
  - 3.29.74 - 2026-02-16 - Delete history entries without confirmation and render the previous plot.

  - 3.29.72 - 2026-02-16 - Reset plot/UI state before loading a new project to avoid stale plot errors.
  - 3.29.71 - 2026-02-16 - Positioned baseline dropdown near the control and made it scrollable.
  - 3.29.70 - 2026-02-16 - Reworked baseline dropdown click-away handling to keep items visible.
  - 3.29.69 - 2026-02-16 - Prevented baseline dropdown from closing immediately on mouse release.
  - 3.29.68 - 2026-02-16 - Removed blocking grab from baseline dropdown and closed it on click-away.
  - 3.29.67 - 2026-02-16 - Stabilized baseline dropdown focus/visibility handling.
  - 3.29.66 - 2026-02-16 - Fixed baseline multi-select button to reopen the dropdown reliably.
  - 3.29.65 - 2026-02-16 - Kept baseline multi-select dropdown open until focus leaves it.
  - 3.29.64 - 2026-02-16 - Lifted radar titles to avoid overlap with angle labels.
  - 3.29.63 - 2026-02-16 - Restored right-side legends and widened plot panel to make room for them.
  - 3.29.62 - 2026-02-16 - Adjusted legend placement and title spacing to keep legends above plots without overlap.
  - 3.29.61 - 2026-02-16 - Updated baseline labels and legend layout; reduced plot whitespace and set baseline menu background to white.
  - 3.29.60 - 2026-02-16 - Moved baseline multi-selection into the comparison dropdown menu.
  - 3.29.59 - 2026-02-16 - Added multi-baseline comparison selection and averaged baseline logic for radar, cartesian, bar, and time-series plots.
  - 3.29.58 - 2026-02-11 - Export report HTML as a standalone file with embedded assets.
  - 3.29.57 - 2026-02-11 - Allow report export to succeed when assets are locked; warn instead.
